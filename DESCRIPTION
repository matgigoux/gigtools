Maintainer: Mathieu Gigoux <matgigoux at gmail.com>
Description: I was tired to always re-writing functions because I couldn't find them after many months of not using them and not finding them.

These are typically low level but highly practical for experimental biologist and amateur bioinformaticians.

Please note that these were writen by me and for me.
